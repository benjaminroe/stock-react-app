### How this app was created

To get started with React, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with Vercel, you can use the [Create-React-App CLI](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-react-app my-app
```
